Jetpack Compose + MVI pet project

I used FluxRedux lib from Freeletics for MVI, wich is great, but unfortunatly uses ExperimentalCoroutinesApi, so you can see this annotation too often.
And Jetpack Compose Animations are experimental too.

First screen is a list of Marvel characters with pagination, second one is a details screen with parallax image effect.

I used Koin for DI, Relam for DB, modularization for improving build time.

Enjoy!
